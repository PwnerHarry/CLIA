//abstract={The growing popularity of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) for solving many-objective problems warrants the careful investigation of their search controls and failure modes. This study contributes a new diagnostic assessment framework for rigorously evaluating the effectiveness, reliability, efficiency, and controllability of MOEAs as well as identifying their search controls and failure modes. The framework is demonstrated using the recently introduced Borg MOEA, -NSGA-II, -MOEA, IBEA, OMOPSO, GDE3, MOEA/D, SPEA2, and NSGA-II on 33 instances of 18 test problems from the DTLZ, WFG, and CEC 2009 test suites. The diagnostic framework exploits Sobol's variance decomposition to provide guidance on the algorithms¡¯ non-separable, multi-parameter controls when performing a many-objective search. This study represents one of the most comprehensive empirical assessments of MOEAs ever completed. }

//abstract = { Since the suggestion of a computing procedure of multiple {Pareto}-optimal solutions in multi-objective optimization problems in the early Nineties, researchers have been on the look out for a procedure which is computationally fast and simultaneously capable of finding a well-converged and well-distributed set of solutions. Most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) developed in the past decade are either good for achieving a well-distributed solutions at the expense of a large computational effort or computationally fast at the expense of achieving a not-so-good distribution of solutions. For example, although the Strength {Pareto} Evolutionary Algorithm or SPEA (Zitzler and Thiele, 1999) produces a much better distribution compared to the elitist non-dominated sorting GA or NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002a), the computational time needed to run SPEA is much greater. In this paper, we evaluate a recently-proposed steady-state MOEA (Deb et al., 2003) which was developed based on the ¦Å-dominance concept introduced earlier (Laumanns et al., 2002) and using efficient parent and archive update strategies for achieving a well-distributed and well-converged set of solutions quickly. Based on an extensive comparative study with four other state-of-the-art MOEAs on a number of two, three, and four objective test problems, it is observed that the steady-state MOEA is a good compromise in terms of convergence near to the {Pareto}-optimal front, diversity of solutions, and computational time. Moreover, the ¦Å-MOEA is a step closer towards making MOEAs pragmatic, particularly allowing a decision-maker to control the achievable accuracy in the obtained {Pareto}-optimal solutions. }

//abstract="Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are increasingly being investigated to solve many-objective optimization problems. However, most algorithms recently proposed for many-objective optimization cannot find {Pareto} optimal solutions with good properties on convergence, spread, and distribution. Often, the algorithms favor one property at the expense of the other. In addition, in some applications it takes a very long time to evaluate solutions, which prohibits running the algorithm for a large number of generations. In this work to obtain good representations of the {Pareto} optimal set we investigate a large population MOEA, which employs adaptive $\epsilon$-box dominance for selection and neighborhood recombination for variation, using a very short number of generations to evolve the population. We study the performance of the algorithm on some functions of the DTLZ family, showing the importance of using larger populations to search on many-objective problems and the effectiveness of employing adaptive $\epsilon$-box dominance with neighborhood recombination that take into account the characteristics of many-objective landscapes.",

//abstract="This work proposes a method to control the dominance area of solutions in order to induce appropriate ranking of solutions for the problem at hand, enhance selection, and improve the performance of MOEAs on combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed method can control the degree of expansion or contraction of the dominance area of solutions using a user-defined parameter S. Modifying the dominance area of solutions changes their dominance relation inducing a ranking of solutions that is different to conventional dominance. In this work we use 0/1 multiobjective knapsack problems to analyze the effects on solutions ranking caused by contracting and expanding the dominance area of solutions and its impact on the search performance of a multi-objective optimizer when the number of objectives, the size of the search space, and the complexity of the problems vary. We show that either convergence or diversity can be emphasized by contracting or expanding the dominance area. Also, we show that the optimal value of the area of dominance depends strongly on all factors analyzed here: number of objectives, size of the search space, and complexity of the problems.",

//abstract="Many-objective optimization has been gaining increasing attention in the evolutionary multiobjective optimization community, and various approaches have been developed to solve many-objective problems in recent years. However, the existing empirically comparative studies are often restricted to only a few approaches on a handful of test problems. This paper provides a systematic comparison of eight representative approaches from the six angles to solve many-objective problems. The compared approaches are tested on four groups of well-defined continuous and combinatorial test functions, by three performance metrics as well as a visual observation in the decision space. We conclude that none of the approaches has a clear advantage over the others, although some of them are competitive on most of the problems. In addition, different search abilities of these approaches on the problems with different characteristics suggest a careful choice of approaches for solving a many-objective problem in hand.",

However, as lack of diversity maintenance mechanism, the obtained final set may only concentrate in a subregion of {Pareto} front. In this paper, we propose a diversity maintenance strategy for AR to balance convergence and diversity during evolution process. We employ grid to define an adaptive neighborhood for each individual, whose size varies with the number of objectives. Moreover, a layering selection scheme integrates it and AR to pick out well-converged individuals and prohibit or postpone the archive of adjacent individuals. From an extensive comparative study with original AR and two other diversity maintenance methods, the proposed method shows a good balance among convergence, uniformity and spread.",

//abstract="This paper discusses how preference information of the decision maker can in general be integrated into multiobjective search. The main idea is to first define the optimization goal in terms of a binary performance measure (indicator) and then to directly use this measure in the selection process. To this end, we propose a general indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) that can be combined with arbitrary indicators. In contrast to existing algorithms, IBEA can be adapted to the preferences of the user and moreover does not require any additional diversity preservation mechanism such as fitness sharing to be used. It is shown on several continuous and discrete benchmark problems that IBEA can substantially improve on the results generated by two popular algorithms, namely NSGA-II and SPEA2, with respect to different performance measures.",

Such an algorithm was previosly developed by the authors. Two approaches were adopted to parallelize our algorithm (both of them based on a master-slave scheme): one uses Pthreads (shared memory) and the other one uses MPI (distributed memory). We conduct a small comparative study to analyze the impact that the parallelization has on performance. Our results indicate that both parallel versions produce important improvements in the execution times of the algorithm (with respect to the serial version) while keeping the quality of the results obtained.",

//abstract="The hypervolume measure is one of the most frequently applied measures for comparing the results of evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms (EMOA). The idea to use this measure for selection is self-evident. A steady-state EMOA will be devised, that combines concepts of non-dominated sorting with a selection operator based on the hypervolume measure. The algorithm computes a well distributed set of solutions with bounded size thereby focussing on interesting regions of the {Pareto} front(s). By means of standard benchmark problems the algorithm will be compared to other well established EMOA. The results show that our new algorithm achieves good convergence to the {Pareto} front and outperforms standard methods in the hypervolume covered. We also studied the applicability of the new approach in the important field of design optimization. In order to reduce the number of time consuming precise function evaluations, the algorithm will be supported by approximate function evaluations based on Kriging metamodels. First results on an airfoil redesign problem indicate a good performance of this approach, especially if the computation of a small, bounded number of well-distributed solutions is desired.",

//abstract="After adequately demonstrating the ability to solve different two-objective optimization problems, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) must demonstrate their efficacy in handling problems having more than two objectives. In this study, we have suggested three different approaches for systematically designing test problems for this purpose. The simplicity of construction, scalability to any number of decision variables and objectives, knowledge of the shape and the location of the resulting {Pareto}-optimal front, and introduction of controlled difficulties in both converging to the true {Pareto}-optimal front and maintaining a widely distributed set of solutions are the main features of the suggested test problems. Because of the above features, they should be found useful in various research activities on MOEAs, such as testing the performance of a new MOEA, comparing different MOEAs, and better understanding of the working principles of MOEAs.",

In this paper, we focus on analyzing the effectiveness and efficiency of non-dominated sorting in multi- and many-objective evolutionary algorithms. The effectiveness of non-dominated sorting is verified by considering two popular evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II and KnEA, which were designed for solving multi- and many-objective optimization problems, respectively. The efficiency of non-dominated sorting is evaluated by comparing several state-of-the-art non-dominated sorting algorithms for multi- and many-objective optimization problems. These results provide important insights to adopt non-dominated sorting in developing novel multi- and many-objective evolutionary algorithms.",

//abstract="Maintaining balance between convergence and diversity is of great importance for many-objective evolutionary algorithms. The recently suggested non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III could obtain a fair diversity but the convergence is unsatisfactory. For this purpose, an improved NSGA-III algorithm based on objective space decomposition (we call it NSGA-III-OSD) is proposed for enhancing the convergence of NSGA-III. Firstly, the objective space is decomposed into several subspaces by clustering the weight vectors uniformly distributed in the whole objective space and each subspace has its own population. Secondly, individual information is exchanged between subspaces in the mating selection phase. Finally, the convergence information is added in the environmental selection phase by the penalty-based boundary intersection distance. The proposed NSGA-III-OSD is tested on a number of many-objective optimization problems with three to fifteen objectives and compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that NSGA-III-OSD is competitive with the chosen state-of-the-art designs in convergence and diversity.",

//abstract="NSGA-II and its contemporary EMO algorithms were found to be vulnerable in solving many-objective optimization problems having four or more objectives. It is not surprising that EMO researchers have been concentrating in developing efficient algorithms for many-objective optimization problems. Recently, authors suggested an extension of NSGA-II (NSGA-III) which is based on the supply of a set of reference points and demonstrated its working in three to 15-objective optimization problems. In this paper, NSGA-III's reference point allocation task is made adaptive so that a better distribution of points can be found. The approach is compared with NSGA-III and a previous adaptive approach on a number of constrained and unconstrained many-objective optimization problems. NSGA-III and its adaptive extension proposed here open up new directions for research and development in the area of solving many-objective optimization problems.",

An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse_article_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_forced_etal
"no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
"yes" enables

CTLmax_names_forced_etal
The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
is not greater than this value!

CTLnames_show_etal
The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal

CTLuse_alt_spacing
"no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
"yes" enables

CTLalt_stretch_factor
If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.

CTLdash_repeated_names
"no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
"yes" enables

CTLname_format_string
The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
guide.
IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,

CTLname_latex_cmd
A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
The default is empty.

CTLname_url_prefix
The prefix text used before URLs.
The default is "[Online]. Available:" A space will be inserted after this
text. If this space is not wanted, just use \relax at the end of the
prefix text.


Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out.
